## Summary Section

To begin: on the top left you will find a character button. Clicking on this button will give you an A-Z index. Use this index to access a list of Marvel characters. Characters are listed by their first names.

Example: If you want information on Captain America, click on the "C" from the index. For easier accessibily, you can also click the letter on your keyboard.

These characters are being accessed from the Marvel API.

You will notice that some of the buttons are red on the A-Z index. This is because they are disabled, due to the fact that information has not yet been recieved for those characters yet. You will know that the information has come back and the button in enabled when the button turns white.

The statistics and background of each character is accessed from the Super Hero API, so not all characters will have information.
